# IoT-assignements

## Assignment 1
For this assignment I had to build a cloud-based IoT system that collects information from a set of virtual environmental sensors using the MQTT protocol. Moreover, I also had to build a simple web site to display the data collected from the sensors. The MQTT is controlled by the cloud-based backend, Google cloud IoT platform in my case.

## Assignment 2
For this assignment I had to build on-top of the cloud-based components developed in the first assignment. I had to replace the virtual environmental stations with new ones built using the RIOT-OS and MQTT-SN protocol. I also used the native emulator of RIOT-OS to run my stations and generate values over MQTT-SN that need to arrive to the cloud via the MQTT.

**Note**: the code is made to work with my credentials on my personal google account.
I did not upload the keys, If u want to run it, you need to make your own setup.
