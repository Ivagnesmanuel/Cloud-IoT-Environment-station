# IoT-assignement1

For this assignment we have to create a cloud-based IoT system that collects information from a set of virtual environmental sensors using the MQTT protocol. Moreover, we also need to create a simple web site to display the data collected from the sensors.
The MQTT is controlled by the cloud-based backend, Google cloud IoT platform in my case.
